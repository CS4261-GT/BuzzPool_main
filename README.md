# BuzzPool_main

Instructions to run the code:
Clone or download the react-native-calendar repository from GitHub. Open the directory in the command window.

Run Yarn Install first. Then...

Run the application by running the command:

expo start

If expo is not already installed, set it up by running the command:

npm install -g expo-cli

Once the application has loaded and the command above is run, a QR code will appear in the terminal. Download the Expo Go app on a physical phone and scan the QR code to load the app on the phone. Alternatively, type ‘i’ for an iOS emulator (or ‘a’ for an android emulator-- not tested yet on android) in the terminal.
